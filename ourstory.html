    <h4>08th June</h4>
    <p>It’s been a while since I’ve been here, so maybe we try this again? I’m not sure where to begin. Do we shake
      hands, do we hug, or do we just fall back into the rhythm we once knew? Maybe I’ll just dive right in, because
      there’s so much I want to share with you and I have a feeling we’ll be meeting here more often.
    <p>


    <p>Let’s start with this week. A week where I met someone who completely caught me off guard. Okay, maybe that’s not
      entirely true, I had quiet hopes that this day would come, but I didn’t anticipate it happening now, and not in
      the way it did anyway. I’ve always wondered what it might feel like to sit across from someone and feel undone in the
      best way by their presence. To be in awe of who they are, not because of anything grand, but simply because they
      are themselves. This week, that wondering became something more than a deep-seated yearning. I feel full,
      full of gratitude, curiosity, and this quiet yet resounding thrill of having stumbled into a moment that feels
      rare. I watched the sunset at Momo Kuro and shared wine with the most beautiful woman I have ever laid my eyes on and it was in the spaces between the sips and the
      giggles that I felt comfort, ease, and safety. Her openness and softness felt like an invitation to lean in, so I
      did.

    <p>The way we crossed paths feels like a strange mix of accident and inevitability. I didn’t expect us to even talk,
      but we did, and that conversation somehow became a turning point, even for things in her life I don’t fully
      understand (and maybe shouldn’t). I’m not sure what to make of that, but I know what I felt sitting across from
      her. Something stirred in me that I hadn’t felt in a long time, and I knew my life would not be quite the same
      again, no matter what the days that follow may bring.</p>

    I’m drawn to her, to the way she thinks, to the way she’s made me feel noticed leading up to this week, maybe even
    seen (is it too soon to say that?). And yet, I find myself wondering if it’s okay to follow that pull. Am I stepping
    into something I’m not ready for, especially knowing there’s a silent third who is as much a part of this
    unfolding story as we are?

    I don’t have the answers yet.

    But I know that day reminded me that real, disarming connections exist. And that, all on its own, is enough.</p>

    <p> ❀</p>

    <h4>15th June</h4>
    <p>This past week has felt nothing short of fuzzy (does this paint the right image of warmth, comfort, ease and joy?). I’m having such an incredible time getting to know one of the most
      remarkable women I’ve ever met. Not just through our conversations, but in the quiet ways I keep witnessing her in
      her own world. I recently watched her go home to be with her family, and I had the chance to see how her kindness seems to
      flow so freely to everyone around her, and even to herself.</p>

    <p>I find myself in awe of her openness, her warmth, her willingness to let me step into her life. Even on the days
      that pulled us in different directions, we somehow found our way back to each other, and it felt as though the day
      wasn’t complete until we had spoken. And then, that weekend, she found my podcast (Reader, I wanted to disappear
      into the earth!). Still, as much as I feared her seeing that side of me, I’m grateful. Because that moment opened
      a door, and through it we began to share more of ourselves than I ever thought I’d be able to, especially so soon.
      I’ve never opened up this quickly before, and it feels… good. It feels right.</p>

    <p>There’s a quiet dance happening between us, a subtle pull that feels both playful and certain. She loves being in
      control, and so do I, and I can’t help but imagine how exhilarating it might be to see where that takes us. And
      yet, my heart is not without its weight. With every day that we grow closer, I’m reminded of something I haven’t
      said aloud often, the presence of the silent third. She found our messages, and she has since walked away. I know
      how much she meant, how good she was, and I can only imagine the hurt that must come with such a loss. I carry so
      much compassion in my heart for both parties and the truth
      lingers with me, quietly heavy. </p>
    <p>So I find myself here, wondering, am I stepping forward too soon, or is this something worth risking? Is what
      we’re building strong enough to carry us through uncertain ground? Once again, I don’t have the answers and yet again, I am assured
      that
      what’s unfolding is something worth holding onto.</p>
    <p>❀</p>
    <h4>22nd June</h4>
    <p>Lately, it feels as though we’ve been drawing closer with every passing moment. This past weekend, I suggested we
      go for a Sunday hike and brunch, but my Bub said she wanted to see me much sooner. My heart lit up, because I had
      been longing for the same (I did not say this out loud so this will stay here with us, promise?).</p>

    <p>She invited me to her home, and though I’m usually hesitant to enter someone’s personal space so soon, with her,
      I
      felt safe. <span style="color:#4b5c09"><em>Completely safe.</em></span> When I arrived, she welcomed me into her beautiful space. It is warm and
      so full of her essence. She had even bought snacks for me and that made me feel so seen. To be loved,
      I
      think, is to be both noticed and accommodated. I'm such a picky eater that I am always glad when I am considered.

      The rest of the day unfolded in a gentle rhythm of quiet work and lingering
      kisses. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed kissing someone this much, this soon.</p>

    <p>What followed is something I’ll hold delicately in my heart. We shared hours of closeness, of touch, of intimacy
      that went beyond the physical. In her arms, I felt so safe and truly held. The way she held me, the way her lips
      met
      mine, the way her body seemed to speak its own language of affection back at mine. It was as though we had been
      yearning for each other for a lifetime and then there we were, safe with each other. I knew there and then that I
      will undoubtedly fall
      in
      love with her.
    </p>
    <p>❀</p>

    <h4>29th June</h4>
    <p>We started reading The Silent Patient together, and I can’t help but feel over the moon. I’ve always longed for a
      reading partner, and suddenly here it was, unfolding right in front of my eyes. Do you know what's funny? The most beautiful things really do find me when I am not looking nor seeking. Each morning we would wake up and I would
      read to her. We rarely ever made it to the end of a chapter though (lol?). We would get so lost in each
      other’s arms and lost in each other’s lips. She would urge me to keep reading, but how could I, when she was looking
      at me with eyes that seemed to pierce right through my soul?</p>

    <p>That was the sweet part, the kind of tenderness I’ll always carry. But you can probably sense what comes next.
      Because what happens when two people meet and connect so quickly, sharing interests, perspectives, and even
      weaving parts of their lives together in just a month, while old, unhealed wounds are quietly demanding attention?
      Yes. We parted ways.</p>

    <p>It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. To separate from someone I was just beginning to fall in
      love with felt like being pulled out of the deepest, safest sleep, and never being able to find my way back to it
      again.</p>
    </p>
    <h4>6th July</h4>

    <P>This week, I cried harder than I have in a long time. I finally allowed myself to feel the weight of everything
      I’ve
      been trying to bury. For so long, I kept telling myself I shouldn’t be this hurt. I kept telling myself that I had
      no right to feel
      broken. But the truth is, I am hurt. Deeply. </P>

    <p>In the midst of this, I started a new certification. That is so type A of me because what better way to rediect the pain 
      than to bury my head in books and deadlines? This path is however a
      path I’ve always dreamed of, but always pushed aside until now. My time with Kgomotso awakened something in me. She
      reminded
      me what it feels like to chase the things that set my heart on fire. Watching her unwavering dedication to
      becoming the best version of herself lit a spark in me that I didn’t even realize had gone out. She has been the
      quiet strength and inspiration I didn’t know I needed and this step forward is because of that.</p>



    <p> It does, however, break me that I can’t talk to the one person I want to reach out to every moment of the day. It
      hurts that
      even though nothing was wrong between us, I still have to carry the heaviness of this separation. I kept hoping
      that
      with
      time it would start to feel easier, that the ache would soften, but now I see this is going to be one of the
      hardest things I’ve ever had to move through.</p>


    <p>On Ava by Pip Millet: I chose Ava by Pip to open the f(heal) playlist because there’s a message in it. The
      message
      is both raw and honest. It’s one of those songs that crack my heart open and I really hope the lines highlighted
      below spoke to my pookie the way they did to me. I needed it to be a reminder that we are not alone in what we are
      going
      through and that
      we're not alone in whatever we're feeling.</p>

    <p class="song">You're never on your own <br>
      We're never fully grown <br>
      You'll grow through this <br>
      Painful as it is <br>
      You've always got this shoulder <br>
      Feeling lonely you come over, Ava <br>
      Fight to stop you hurting, Ava, <br>
      Don't try pushing me away, Ava, <br>
      Know that I am here to stay. <br>
      You're never on your own <br>
      I will pick up the phone <br>
      Kisses and hugs, I just love you <br>
      I think of all the time when <br>
      You were there for me & you cared for me.
    </p>
    <p>❀</p>

    <h4>13th July</h4>

    <p>I’ve just finished reading The Silent Patient. A part of me wishes she had been there with me as I turned those
      final pages, but I realize now that I needed to read it on my own. I needed to sit with the emotions it stirred in
      me, to truly feel them, so that I could begin to heal.

      There’s a passage that touched me deeply, one that I want to hold close and share here: I felt an unfamiliar
      happiness just being in her presence; as though a secret
      door
      had been held open, and Kathy had beckoned me across the threshold - into a magical world of warmth and light and
      color and hundreds of orchids in a dazzling confetti.</p>

    <p>I may not know what the path ahead holds, but I do know now that I now have enough evidence to know that the kind of
      love
      I long for truly exists. And for now, I will hold onto that knowing, gently, for as long as I need.</p>
    <p>❀</p>

    <h4>20th July</h4>

    <p>I do not have anything to say this week. I am sitting with hopes that everything will works itself out, that is all from me.</p>

    <p>❀</p>
    <h4>27th July</h4>
    <p>On the 26th, we said our final goodbyes. I know I said we parted ways earlier but we found our way back to each
      other. We had to, I needed her and she needed me. This was the beginning of a yearning I never imagined I could
      feel. I know
      this is the start of the rest of our lives, but how do I carry on without her sweet, angelic voice? How do I carry
      on without the morning forehead kisses, the sudden bursts of laughter, the quiet nods that said “I hear you” in a
      way only she could? How do I carry on without my anchor? How can life feel normal without her near?</p>


    <p>Every day after that, I cried. I cried until my head ached in ways I didn’t know were possible. I didn’t cry from
      sadness alone, but from the overwhelming gratitude of having experienced a love that restored parts of me I
      thought were lost. To have been loved so deeply, so fully, in such a short time, has shown me that I am capable of
      loving deeply and being loved deeply. I am endlessly grateful for the moments we shared, and I will treasure the
      memories we created forever.</p>

    In the midst of this, I stumbled upon a body of work that might have truly saved me. It was a piece of writing that
    spoke to me as if it had been written just for me, helping me understand that I am not alone in this journey of
    healing and self-discovery. It reminded me that it’s okay to feel lost, to feel broken, and that the path to healing
    is often marked by tears and heartache. Even in this heartache, I am learning to be resilient, to sit with my
    emotions, to let them flow through me, heavy though they may be. I will make it through... despite, despite, despite.

    <h4>3rd August</h4>

    <p>My heart aches because I know her heart aches too. If my grief is this deep, I can only imagine what hers feels like. I wish I could take away the pain but I can't so I beat against the waves and carry on.</p>
    <p>❀</p>

    <h4>10th August</h4>
    <p>This feels like the beginning of a new chapter in my life. I trust that what will unfold from this season will be
      one of the most beautiful gifts I’ve ever received, and I welcome it with care and love. It has not been easy to
      accept that this is the
      right decision
      for us, but together we found the courage to pause what has been, for me, the most meaningful love story. In this
      relationship, I have felt deeply seen and truly heard. I know the love I envision for myself is out there, and I
      carry forward with gratitude. I am thankful that the Lord trusted me with this love. I am thankful that he blessed
      me with a love that brought peace to my heart and calm
      to my spirit.</p>



    <p>On the 10th, I woke up with a quiet knowing that today would change everything. I am no longer resisting the changes
      that life calls for. Staying the same takes just as much energy as choosing to grow, and so I step into this
      change
      with the awareness that it serves the best path for both of us.</p>






    </p>

    <h4>17th August</h4>

    <p>We spent the weekend together at a Women’s Retreat, and it felt like the most beautiful ending to this chapter of
      our story. I spent that time reflecting on the way we tiptoe around heartbreak, as if it were a chair someone
      forgot to push in, a presence we learn to avoid with careful ease, something everyone notices but no one names.
      It’s strange how fluent we have become in this quiet dance of avoidance. We know how to change the subject, but
      what we cannot escape is that heartbreak lingers anyway. It sits in the pauses, in sentences we leave unfinished
      because the ending tastes bitter, metallic even.</p>

    <p>Between the kisses and the laughter this weekend, I felt the quiet ache of knowing that we are each just two
      little girls, both heartbroken at having to let each other go. We can look away for as long as we like, but that
      chair, the heartbreak, remains. It is present, it is heavy, and it is ours to carry.</p>
    <p>I suppose this is the moment we both realized that to love each other meant, in some way, to let each other go.
      This will be my final journal entry for this chapter, and I choose to hold onto these last moments, to treasure
      the joy we shared for as long as I can. Perhaps the next time I revisit this will be in a different light. </p>
      
      <p>Thank you for keeping me company, this experience has changed my life.
